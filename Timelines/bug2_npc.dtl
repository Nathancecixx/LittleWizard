We meet again! I see you have a fragment already, bravo!
- Nice to meet you again, I assume you’re my guide then, thank you. What’s next?
	Glad to be of help! There’s another key-fragment at deep in this dungeon. Get it, and you’ll have 2/3 fragments. You got this!

- What the, I thought I was done seeing you, what do you want now
	It’s not any nicer seeing you. There’s another fragment in this dungeon, break a leg.
